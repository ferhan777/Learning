MySqli support five types of fetching result
----------------------------------------------

1.fetch_assoc() get the next row as an associative array
2.fetch_row() get the next row as an indexed array
3.fetch_array() offers a choice of array types
4.fetch_all() creates an array containing all rows
5.fetch_object() get the next row as an object

buffered and unbuffered queries
********************************
buffered query store result in php memory and we can use the internal pointer and data can be reused while 
in unbuffered query consume less php memory but load on dbserver

non prepared statement by default query() immediately return result set (Buffered)

for unbuffered query we use real_query() leaves result set on dbserver and we need further functions to use it like
retrieve result with use_result() or store_result() however store_result convert query from buffered to unbuffered
cant use num_rows or data_seek() in unbuffered query alternatively we can use the get_result() to assign result set to a mysqli object then store result

freeing MySqli resources
-------------------------
There are three methods to do it.. they are as follows 
1. close()
2. free()
3. free_result()

for prep stmt we use $stmt->close() destroy a statment and cancel pending results then close or store before executing another query

$stmt->free_result() clears a strored result from memory but the statement object can be reused

$db->close() closes the database connection

free resources to avoid "Commands out of sync" error and unused result prevent further query execution 
php automatically closed but mysqli its recommended to do it.. it will improve efficiencies
