 <p>N THE NAME OF THE COMPASSIONATE
AND MERCIFUL GOD
PRAISE be ascribed to God the lord of worlds; and the
blessing of God be upon our Lord Mohammed, and upon
all his posterity and companions. But to proceed: The poor,
and needy of the forgiveness of his bountiful lord,
Mohammed Ibn Fat’h Allah El Bailuni states, that the fol-
lowing is what he extracted from the epitome of the Katib
Mohammed Ibn Jazzi El Kelbi (upon whom be the mercy of God), from the travels of the
theologian Abu Abd Allah Mohammed Ibn Abd Allah El Lawati of Tanjiers known by
the surname of Ibn Batuta and, that he did not extract anything except what was strange
and unknown, or, known by report, but not believed on account of its rarity, and the
frequent carelessness of historians in delivering down what has been reported, but what
he himself considered as true, in consequence of the fidelity of the traveler, and because
he had written what he believed to be credible from histories of various nations and
countries; and, because that which has been reported by faithful witnesses, generally
receives credit and excites inquiry. Some of his statements, indeed, are opposed to the
statements of others; as, for instance, his accounts of what he saw of the aromatic roots of
Hindustan, which differ from those given by the physicians: and yet his accounts are
probably the true ones.</p>
